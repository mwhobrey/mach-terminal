# Continuation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-04-21

## Purpose

Use this document to resume work in new sessions without re-discovering context.
It captures what shipped recently, what is still open, and the safest next
execution path.

## Current Repo State

- Branch: `master`
- Stack: Tauri v2 + Rust backend, React/TypeScript frontend, xterm.js renderer
- Latest completed tranche: enhancement **tranche 6** — provider reliability + smoke contracts (hook/onboarding reliability helpers/tests, backend provider/keyring edge-path assertions, provider UX smoke coverage); see git log for `6eb0688`.
- Invoke transport: `npm run test:invoke:strict` runs as part of **`npm run stability:signoff` on all platforms.** On Windows the runner exercises the serialization contract via filtered lib tests (MockRuntime/linking avoids `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`); on Unix run `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --features invoke-smoke --test shell_integration_invoke_smoke` for full transport assertions ([`docs/runtime-contracts.md`](runtime-contracts.md)).

## Recently Shipped Slices

### Enhancement tranche 6 (provider reliability + smoke contracts)

- Frontend reliability seams added and tested for provider orchestration:
  - request supersession/stale-response guard helpers in [`src/hooks/useProviderAiState.ts`](../src/hooks/useProviderAiState.ts)
  - onboarding failure/disable-state helpers in [`src/components/FirstRunSetup.tsx`](../src/components/FirstRunSetup.tsx)
- Backend reliability assertions expanded:
  - provider auth/env/keyring edge behavior in [`src-tauri/tests/provider_host_behavior.rs`](../src-tauri/tests/provider_host_behavior.rs)
  - keyring validation/error-prefix contracts in [`src-tauri/src/provider_secrets.rs`](../src-tauri/src/provider_secrets.rs)
- Added provider UX smoke coverage in [`src/core/providerUiState.smoke.test.ts`](../src/core/providerUiState.smoke.test.ts) and updated README scripted-smoke summary.

### Enhancement tranche 5 (docs truth, link smoke depth, release-readiness notes)

- Updated `README` Next Build Steps to reflect shipped provider adapters and current focus (provider UX/reliability, scripted smoke depth, release hardening).
- Refreshed this handoff to remove stale invoke-platform caveats and consolidate invoke transport history/current behavior.
- Added compiler-style link-span smoke assertions (`C:\src\main.ts:42:7`, `/src/main.ts:42:7`) and aligned file-link ranges to underline path-only spans.
- Expanded `RELEASING.md` with a CI enforcement map (`ci.yml` matrix/signoff/security/release-smoke + `release.yml` preflight/checksum publish).

### Enhancement tranche 4 (invoke spine, OSC 133 depth, scripted smoke)

- Windows-safe invoke harness: nested include [`tests/shell_integration_invoke_smoke/body.rs`](../src-tauri/tests/shell_integration_invoke_smoke/body.rs) so Cargo does not compile MockRuntime-backed sources as a stray integration crate on Windows.
- OSC 133: [`tests/pty_behavior.rs`](../src-tauri/tests/pty_behavior.rs) drains real PTY output through the decoder; Settings manual snippets + README cross-links for OSC 133 adoption.
- Atomic `settings.json` saves retry on `NotFound` as well as permission races ([`settings.rs`](../src-tauri/src/settings.rs)).

### Enhancement tranche 3 (composer scroll, assist metrics, OSC 133, CI)

- **Composer scroll:** `Ctrl+Alt+Page Up` / `Page Down` pages xterm output while the composer stays focused; pure helper in [`src/core/composerOutputScroll.ts`](../src/core/composerOutputScroll.ts) + smoke in [`src/core/composerInput.smoke.test.ts`](../src/core/composerInput.smoke.test.ts).
- **Assist metrics profile flag:** `show_composer_assist_metrics` on [`TerminalProfile`](../src-tauri/src/models.rs) / [`profilePatch`](../src/core/terminal.ts) + Settings toggle; [`TerminalSurface.tsx`](../src/components/TerminalSurface.tsx) shows metrics when `import.meta.env.DEV` **or** the flag is set.
- **OSC 133:** Incremental decoder [`src-tauri/src/osc133.rs`](../src-tauri/src/osc133.rs), PTY reader emits `pty-command-marker` (see [`docs/runtime-contracts.md`](runtime-contracts.md)); UI shows latest hint on [`MachStatusStrip.tsx`](../src/components/MachStatusStrip.tsx). Optional copy-paste snippets in [`src/core/machShellSnippets.ts`](../src/core/machShellSnippets.ts).

- Added deterministic smoke contracts for:
  - command-palette keyboard lifecycle and focused find intent flow
  - terminal link extraction + activation policy (allow http/https + safe file, reject unsafe schemes/remote file hosts)
  - exited-session lifecycle composition (overlay summary, tab tooltip code suffix, batch order, restart cwd fallback)
- Kept quality gates unchanged (signoff + nightly already invoke `test:ux:smoke`) while broadening smoke coverage surface.

  - focused-only terminal UI request consumption with seq fast-forward semantics
  - no deferred command replay when a previously unfocused pane later gains focus
  - follow-output toggle contract (`setFollowOutput`) and scroll-to-bottom coupling
  - deterministic split/close active-pane fallback under rapid close transitions
- Expanded workspace unit coverage by extracting active-pane fallback selection into a pure helper used by `closePane`.
- `test:ux:smoke` auto-discovers this tranche via `*.smoke.test.ts` naming; no gate rewiring required.

Primary files:

- `src/state/workspace.ts`
- `src/state/workspace.test.ts`
- `README.md`

### UX smoke tranche (history replay + AI explain/fix contracts)

- Added deterministic smoke coverage for checklist items `3` and `4` behavior contracts:
  - case-insensitive history search filtering
  - dual empty-state messaging (`no history` vs `no search matches`)
  - replay/explain/fix handlers receiving full command text (not truncated display text)
  - explain/fix wiring from settings modal callbacks into history panel handlers
- Added AI orchestration contract tests for history actions:
  - explain/fix intent mapping (`explain_command`, `fix_command`)
  - prompt shaping and stable pending/success/failure status strings
- Strengthened backend history semantics guards:
  - newest-first query ordering with limit enforcement
  - case-insensitive + session-scoped filtering

  - xterm pane remains non-interactive for stdin (`disableStdin=true`)
  - completion/prediction/history live in the composer only
- Added backend completion command (`composer_complete`) with:
  - cwd-aware path completion (relative, absolute, quoted, `~` expansion)
  - command-name completion from PATH executable scan + shell builtin index
  - cache invalidation for PATH command index (time + PATH-key aware)
- Added frontend completion/prediction/history engines and deterministic tests:
  - pure completion state/cycle helpers
  - pure history navigation + prediction acceptance guards
  - smoke contracts covering completion cycling + prediction/history acceptance semantics
- Added composer discoverability/hardening hooks:
  - fallback message when completion probing fails
  - bounded history window for prediction/history browsing
  - lightweight assist metrics line (request count, accept count, avg completion latency)

Primary files:

- `src-tauri/src/composer_completion.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- `src/core/composerCompletion.ts`

### Shell status consolidation (P5 follow-up)

- Refactored shell status construction to use shared backend derivation/builders across `pwsh`, `bash`, and `zsh`.
- Consolidated duplicate marker/expected-line/health logic used by:
  - `pwsh_shell_status`
  - `unix_profile_shell_status`
- Consolidated resolved/unresolved row construction while preserving payload semantics:
  - `profilePathSource` (`override` / `auto` / omitted)
  - `backupCount` optionality
  - `health` values and error/null behavior
- Added parity-focused backend tests covering:
  - expected-line match vs stale mismatch
  - resolved/unresolved source semantics
  - cross-shell row invariants for status composition

Primary files:

- `src-tauri/src/shell_integration.rs`
- `docs/runtime-contracts.md`

### Shell status contract guards (error paths + wire shape)

- Added backend contract tests for shell-status rows covering:
  - invalid pwsh override path semantics (`profileResolved=false`, `health=error`, `profilePathSource=override`)
  - unresolved auto path semantics (`profilePathSource` omitted/null, `backupCount` null)
  - serialized wire-shape invariants (`profilePath`, `backupCount`, `profilePathSource`, `error`)
  - canonical shell row ordering/capability invariants (`pwsh`, `bash`, `zsh`)
- Generalized select settings/shell-integration helpers to runtime-generic `AppHandle<R>` signatures to keep test harness pathways compatible across runtimes.

Primary files:

- `src-tauri/src/shell_integration.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/settings.rs`
- `docs/runtime-contracts.md`

### Shell invoke transport (history → current behavior)

Historical rollout: bootstrap smoke → strict promotion → expanded JSON assertions at the transport boundary. Older Windows setups could hit **`STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`** when linking `tauri::test` / MockRuntime into the wrong test binary; **tranche 4** addressed this by splitting Unix integration tests (dev-dependency `tauri` + `test` feature, feature-gated `shell_integration_invoke_smoke`) from a **Windows lib-test fallback** that still pins the wire contract without MockRuntime.

Current scripts: `npm run test:invoke:smoke`, `npm run test:invoke:strict` ([`scripts/invoke-smoke.mjs`](../scripts/invoke-smoke.mjs)); details in [`docs/runtime-contracts.md`](runtime-contracts.md).

Primary files:

- `src-tauri/tests/shell_integration_invoke_smoke.rs`, `src-tauri/tests/shell_integration_invoke_smoke/body.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/shell_integration.rs`
- `scripts/invoke-smoke.mjs`, `scripts/stability-signoff.mjs`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Important Contracts

### Shell integration status contract

Each shell row now includes:

- `health`
- `backupCount`
- `capabilities.supportsBackupRestore`
- `capabilities.supportsProfileOverride`

This is the contract UI code should consume for feature visibility. Avoid
re-introducing shell-kind hardcoded branching in components.

### Backup/restore safety model

- Backup files live beside profile in `.mach-terminal-shell-backups`.
- Restore selection is by backend-issued `backupId`, not raw file paths.
- Backend validates backup candidates by filename pattern and profile target.

### Onboarding prompt semantics

`onboardingInstallPromptSeen` should only be set by:

- successful shell hook install from onboarding, or
- explicit onboarding "Not now" action

Do not set this flag from general onboarding Save/Quick start/Skip flows.

## Known Observations

- `settings_persistence` concurrent-write coverage relies on atomic-save retries for `PermissionDenied` and transient **`NotFound`** races on Windows renames; if a failure persists after retries, treat it as a real regression (not a flake).
- PowerShell profile warnings in local shell startup can appear in tool output
and are unrelated to app tests.
- Provider-keyring behavior is machine-dependent (stored secrets, credential manager availability, environment leakage). Tests in `provider_host_behavior.rs` now tolerate expected local variance while still enforcing user-visible contract classes.

## Strategic Eval (Where We Are / Where We Are Going)

### Where we are now

- Core reliability contracts are in good shape: lifecycle, shell integration, invoke spine, and provider edge-path coverage have automated guardrails.
- UX is increasingly coherent, but still spread across layered surfaces (`FirstRunSetup`, `AppSettingsModal`, status strip, command palette actions).
- Current architecture is still partly “feature islands” sharing contracts, rather than one consistently-composed product shell.

### Where we are going next (first-class app layer)

The next priority is to make Mach feel like **one app** instead of a set of strong subsystems:

1. **First-class provider UX layer**
   - unify copy/status semantics for provider failures and pending states across onboarding, settings, history actions, and freeform prompt entry
   - reduce duplicated state transitions between `FirstRunSetup` and `useProviderAiState` pathways
2. **Cross-surface command consistency**
   - align command-palette actions, status strip hints, and modal toggles so each capability has one canonical state model
3. **Interaction polish with contract tests**
   - continue converting “manual-only” dogfood rows into scripted smoke where possible, especially around settings/palette/surface coordination

## Open Backlog (Recommended Priority)

### 1) First-class app layer (provider UX + surface unification)

Goal: make provider/AI workflows read as one cohesive product flow across onboarding, settings, composer/history actions, and runtime status surfaces.

Potential tasks:

- consolidate duplicated provider UX state handling between `FirstRunSetup` and `useProviderAiState` into shared view-model helpers
- standardize user-facing provider status/error strings and loading semantics across all entry points
- add smoke contracts for “same intent, same outcome” across command palette, settings toggles, and runtime actions

### 2) Shell Integration P5 follow-up (status-path consolidation)

Goal: keep invoke / shell-status contract coverage aligned with backend wire-shape as `shell_integration_status` evolves.

Potential tasks:

- optional: broaden the **Windows** strict-invoke fallback beyond the current single serialization invariant (see `scripts/invoke-smoke.mjs`) once a stable pattern exists
- continue expanding Unix integration assertions in `tests/shell_integration_invoke_smoke/body.rs` while preserving payload contract keys/casing

## Next Session Startup Checklist

1. Read this file and `README.md` "Next Build Steps".
2. Pick one slice and define todo ids before coding.
3. Run baseline verification:
  - `npm run test:types`
  - `npm run test:ux`
  - `npm run test:ux:smoke`
  - `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
4. If touching invoke transport, run both modes and record behavior:
  - `npm run test:invoke:smoke`
  - `npm run test:invoke:strict`
5. Implement in small commits by logical behavior boundary.
6. Re-run the same verification suite before final commit.
